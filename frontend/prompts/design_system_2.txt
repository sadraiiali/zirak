This design system provides the visual and interactive foundation for the Mastodon AI Bot's interaction view, emphasizing a minimalist aesthetic to manage the presentation of complex AI sequence data and significant information density effectively on a single page through progressive disclosure techniques like collapsible step details and modals for LLM calls. Built upon Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling (themed with custom CSS variables inspired by Shadcn UI), Alpine.js for dynamic interactivity, and Lucid Icons for iconography, it defines reusable components like cards, buttons, tags, and layout structures (sidebar, header, footer) to ensure a consistent, clean, and digestible user experience.
